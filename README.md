# Yardbird

This chicken lays `egg`s...

# Benchmark Results

[Scarecrow](https://scarecrow.sgt-pl.com/)

# Running Example

`cargo run -- --filename examples/array_copy.vmt`

# IC3IA

If `ic3ia` binary is located in your system PATH, you can run

```
cargo run -- --filename examples/array_copy.vmt --invoke-ic3ia --print-vmt
```

This gives you the IC3IA output on the decorated transition system generated by yardbird.

# Performance Sampling

We've found that using `samply` is a nice way to find out where yardbird is spending time.
Unsurprisingly, it spends a lot of time making Z3 calls, but we've still been able to get some
speedups by looking at the callgraphs graphs and heatmaps.

### If you don't have `samply` installed already

- `cargo install --locked samply`

### Running `yardbird` with `samply`

- `cargo build`

- `samply record ./target/debug/yardbird --filename examples/array_copy.vmt`

## Building on Linux

I encountered the following error when building on a Linux machine:

```
error: failed to run custom build command for `z3-sys v0.8.1`

Caused by:
  process didn't exit successfully: `/home/cole/Documents/yardbird/target/debug/build/z3-sys-6ba06f331cb40b8a/build-script-build` (exit status: 101)

```

This was resolved by running:

```
sudo apt install libclang-dev
```
